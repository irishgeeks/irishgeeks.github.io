<h1>Irish Geeks Events</h1>

<p>A collective of tech community user group organisers in Dublin who have been running a techie 
    table quizzes annually around end of November or early December time.
</p>
<p>We invite all the tech community user groups to come along for an evening of fun and laughter 
to answer questions that are not typically found in pub quizzes. There isn't a focus on sports or 
pop music or the latest soaps. It'll be all on geeky culture, STEM (more so tech), and what's hot 
or retro in the industry. That's about as much clues we can give you. ;-)
</p>


<h1>Our Code of Conduct</h1>

<p>All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our event are required to agree with the 
    following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect 
    cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
</p>


<h1>The Quick Version</h1>
<p>Our event is dedicated to providing a harassment-free event experience for everyone, regardless 
    of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical 
    appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. 
    We do not tolerate harassment of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery 
    is not appropriate for any event venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other 
    online media. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from 
    the event (without a refund, if applicable) at the discretion of the event organisers.
</p>

<h1>The Less Quick Version</h1>
<p>Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, 
    age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, 
    technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
    harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate 
    physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use 
    sexualised images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use 
    sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the event organisers may take any action they deem 
    appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund.
</p>

<p>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, 
    please contact a member of organisers immediately.
</p>

<p>Event staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, 
    provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration 
    of the event. We value your attendance.
</p>

<p>We expect participants to follow these rules at event and workshop venues and event-related social events.</p>
